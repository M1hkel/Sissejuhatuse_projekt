        <h1>About Us - HAM Team</h1>
        <p>Greetings from the HAM Team! We're a trio of students who, in the spirit of exploration and a shared interest in good food, decided to create this webpage for a school project. Let us share a bit about our journey and what you'll find here.<br><br></p>

        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>We're not seasoned chefs; we're just a group of friends passionate about bringing a touch of culinary delight into our school project. The idea was simple - let's curate a collection of recipes that we could all enjoy, whether we're cooking novices or aspiring chefs.</p>
        <h1>Meet the HAM Team</h1>
        <p>H - Henri<br><br>A - Andrei<br><br>M - Mihkel<br><br>Each letter in HAM represents one of us, contributing our unique perspectives and enthusiasm for this project. We may not be culinary experts, but we're excited to share our discoveries in the kitchen with you.</p>
        <h1>The Heart of HAM</h1>
        <p>This project is more than just recipes on a webpage; it's a snapshot of our learning journey. We may not have Michelin stars or fancy cooking titles, but we have a genuine love for good food and a desire to share it with you.</p>
        <h1>Join Us in the Kitchen</h1>
        <p>As you explore our page, remember that it's a collaborative effort, and we'd love to hear your thoughts. Try out the recipes, share your experiences, and let's celebrate the joy of learning together.</p>
